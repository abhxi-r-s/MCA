    <h1>Blue</h1>
    <p>Blue is like that one friend who's always calm, cool, and collectedâ€”until you spill coffee on their white couch. It's the color that screams "chill out!" while also being the sky's daily fashion choice and the ocean's eternal poker face. Basically, if colors had personalities, blue would be the laid-back guy at a beach party, wearing sunglasses, sipping on something cold, and pretending he doesn't have a care in the world, while secretly stressing about getting sunburned!</p>

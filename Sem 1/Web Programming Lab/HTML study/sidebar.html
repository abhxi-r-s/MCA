    <h1>Chartreuse</h1>
    <p>Chartreuse is like the indecisive cousin of yellow and green that couldn't pick a side, so it just smashed them together and said, "I'm fabulous!" It's the color you get when a lime and a highlighter pen have a wild night out, resulting in something that screams, "I dare you not to notice me!" It’s like the Hulk’s early stages of transformation—vibrant, loud, and a little bit sassy, perfect for making things look bold or possibly radioactive.</p></body>
